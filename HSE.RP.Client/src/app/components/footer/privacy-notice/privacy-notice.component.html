      <govuk-body>If you follow a link to a service provided by another government department, agency or local authority, that organisation will:</govuk-body>
      <govuk-list classes='govuk-list--bullet'>
        <govuk-list-item text="be the data controller" />

        <govuk-list-item text="publish and manage their own privacy notice with details of how to contact them" />
      </govuk-list>

      <govuk-body>This privacy notice tells you what you can expect us to do with your personal information when use this service or have an interaction with us as the Building Safety Regulator.</govuk-body>
      <govuk-body>A data controller determines how and why personal data is processed.</govuk-body>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What data we collect</h2>

      <govuk-body>The personal data we collect from you includes:</govuk-body>

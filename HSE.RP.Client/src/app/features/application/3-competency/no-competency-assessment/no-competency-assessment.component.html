    You will be registered as a class 1 building inspector
  </h1>

  <govuk-body>
    A class 1 building inspector must be supervised by a registered building
    inspector to do BSR-regulated activities, for example assessing plans and
    inspecting buildings.

    <p>
      To register as a class 2, 3 or 4 building inspector, you must have passed
      BSR-approved competency assessment. When you have passed competency
      assessment, you should ask BSR to change your class on the public
      register.

    <p>
      You must pass a BSR-approved competency assessment for the class you want
      to register for.
    </p>

    <p>Assessment is done by BSR-approved providers:</p>

    <govuk-list classes="govuk-list--bullet">
      <govuk-list-item text="Building Safety Competence Foundation (BSCF)" />
      <govuk-list-item
        text="Chartered Association of Building Engineers (CABE)"
      />
      <govuk-list-item text="Total Training and Development (TTD)" />
    </govuk-list>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      If you have not passed your competency assessment
    </h3>

    <p>
      If you have not passed assessment, you can still complete your
      registration. You should apply for the class you are being assessed for,
      but you will be registered as a class 1 building inspector.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can continue to work on regulated building control activities (for the
      class of RBI you are undertaking a competency assessment for) without
      supervision if you are all of the following:
    </p>

    <govuk-list classes="govuk-list--bullet">
      <govuk-list-item text="an existing building control professional" />
      <govuk-list-item text="registered as a class 1 RBI by 6 April " />
      <govuk-list-item
        text="enrolled in, and actively working through, one of the BSR-approved competency assessment schemes by 6 April"
      />
      <govuk-list-item
        text="a scheme provider has not told you that you have not passed your competency assessment for a second time "
      />
    </govuk-list>

    <p>
      You must pass your competency assessment by the deadline that applies to
      the country you will work in to continue working on class 2 and 3
      projects. If you do not, you cannot continue to work on regulated building
      control activities and will be treated as a class 1 trainee RBI.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can request to change your class of registration when you have
      completed a relevant competency assessment.
    </p>

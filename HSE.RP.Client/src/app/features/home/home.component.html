        Use this service to apply to become a registered building inspector in
        England and Wales with the Building Safety Regulator (BSR).

      <govuk-body>
        You must register with BSR to carry out BSR-regulated activities (for
        example, assessing plans and inspecting). This includes for all
        buildings from domestic premises to complex, high-risk, multi-use
        structures.

          >register of building inspectors</a
        >
        for England, and one for Wales. You will be included on the registers
        for the countries you tell us you work in. The registers will include
        your name, your employer, and details of BSR-regulated activities you
        are registered to do. We will tell you in the application which details
        will be published.</govuk-body

      <govuk-body>
        Your registration will be valid for 4 years, unless varied or cancelled
        by BSR. If you register before 1 April 2024, the 4 years begins from 1
        April 2024.
